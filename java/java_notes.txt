	To start with Spring boot project:

- File -> New -> Spring Starter Project
	- Name should be the project name

- Next -> 
	- It should be the latest Spring Boot version
	- Should bring in or select "Spring Boot DevTools" and "Spring Web"
- select Finish

	After the initial setup:
- The JSP files are to be created in the src -> main -> webapp
	- right-clicking on the 'webapp' folder, selecting 'New', (other) searching for 'jsp' and selecting 'JSP File' and name the 	jsp file. 
- There are three minor configuration steps before we can pass data from our controller to the .jsp file:
	- Create the src/main/webapp folder if it does not exist
	- Create the src/main/webapp/WEB-INF folder
	- Edit the src/main/resources/applications.properties file to contain the following code:
		- spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/




imports: 
<!-- New line below to use the JSP Standard Tag Library to use c:out and other tags-->
	- <%@ taglib prefix = "c" uri = "http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"%>
- Must place <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %> at the top of every JSP file for JSTL use.

- Add the following in the JSP file to render CSS and JS files and the location of the files must be in the src/main.resources/static/css or js folder:
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/style.css">
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/app.js"></script>

- For bootstrap add the following in the head of the jsp:
	<!-- for Bootstrap CSS -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/webjars/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
	<!-- YOUR own local CSS -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css"/>
	<!-- For any Bootstrap that uses JS -->
	<script src="/webjars/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
